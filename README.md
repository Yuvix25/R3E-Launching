# R3E Launch Tool
A tool for RaceRoom Racing Experience which shows you launch data.

## Usage
Run the tool, change the Stop Speed to whatever you want, and then it will show you information about 0 to that speed runs.

## Installation
You can check out pre-compiled versions in the [Forum] (might be outdated),
or run the `setup.py` file to compile (into a directory called `R3E_Launching`).
Another thing to note is that `setup.py` requires Python3, and `py2exe` which you can install by running:
```sh
$ pip install py2exe
```
